Once upon a time,
an octopus found some berries and a pina colada
he decided to eat them.
A few days later he started gaining weight
His skin became an ugly shade of blue and purple
Eventually, he turned into a whole berry
After he was a berry, he drank the pina colada 
The drink had a petunia on the straw so how can it be bad
As he drank the colada he started to deflate 
As he was deflating he bacame sad
A gopher named Fimberly sat beside him
Octoberry felt happy now that he had a friend and they lived happily ever after
